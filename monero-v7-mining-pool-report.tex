\section*{Abstract}

An overview of Monero v7 mining pools with a current example of degraded privacy in one of Monero's three privacy methods due to poor practices on the part of mining pools, a report on mitigation strategies including submissions to the blackball database, and a request for comments on best practices or solutions going forward.  This report applies to Monero mainnet version 7 (v7) and showcases degraded privacy due to publicly-available metadata: mining pools' announced finds (blocks) and payments (transactions.)  Mining pools are recommended to improve "privacy by obscurity" by disclosing less information publicly, but simple practices are presented in order to allow mining pools to proactively improve their privacy while maintaining the current level of metadata disclosure.
